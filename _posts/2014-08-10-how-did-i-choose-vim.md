I am now a huge fan of Vim, and I'm gonna dedicate some of the first posts of
this brand new blog on that subject. First, I'm gonna answer the question
"How did I choose Vim".

I began with Notepad++ (yes, I was developing on windows at the beginning...),
which was good (and probably still is), but even with some plugins, it was not
really practical. Then I tried Zend Studios, where I discovered some tools (like
the integrated PHP Documentation, the database integration, ... etc). But it was
relying on Eclipse, which I just can't bear.

Then I stayed a little while on Netbeans (until two years ago or something like
that), before going on PHPStorm, as I had an open source license thanks to my
templating engine, which is not maintained anymore. But, the thing is... All I
ever did use was at most 10% of the capabilities of such monsters. And, getting
a cup of coffee (or tea, or whatever) each time I wanted to launch them was
pretty tiring.

So, I migrated to Sublime Text. It was good, and offered some good plugins. And
then a friend of mine suggested me to use Vim a little bit more than what I was
using it for (botching a script over ssh, ...). Okay, it may seems a little bit
"unfriendly" at first, but I said "meh, let's try it". After I spent a *little*
bit of time (\*cough, cough\*) configuring it to my likings, well, I definitely
adopted it ; it's been now a little bit less than two years since I started
doing so, and I'm still pretty happy with it.

Next time, I'm gonna introduce through a bunch of posts how did I configure it,
even though you may check my [dotFiles repository](http://github.com/taluu/dotFiles)
for my `.vimrc` file.
