Hi there, 

It's been a while I didn't take the time to update my blog. And to be honest, the last time I updated it, all its article were in french, on multiple subjects... Let's say everything that went through this crazy head of mine.

So, now, I think it is time to reset everything. I already changed my old wordpress (which is not accessible anymore...) into a Jekyll system, even though it is now working through a strange hook, as Github Pages does not authorize to add any plugins. 

The old articles are available as "drafts", but are still in french on my blog repository (you'll find the link in the sidebar). Even though there is a lot of crap, once I sort them out, and translate them, they will be retroactively published here. I don't know when I'll do it, or if I will ever do it, so... Don't get your hopes up.

Oh and by the way, most of my technical articles here will probably also be published onto [the dev blog](http://dev.wisembly.com/) of the company I'm currently working at, [Wisembly](http://wisembly.com).

See you soon ! :)
